<p>If this function fails, #mdb_env_close() must be called to discard the #MDB_env handle.
@param[in] env An environment handle returned by #mdb_env_create()
@param[in] path The directory in which the database files reside. This
directory must already exist and be writable.
@param[in] flags Special options for this environment. This parameter
must be set to 0 or by bitwise OR’ing together one or more of the
values described here.
Flags set by mdb_env_set_flags() are also used.</p>
<ul>
<li>#MDB_FIXEDMAP
     use a fixed address for the mmap region. This flag must be specified
     when creating the environment, and is stored persistently in the environment.
	If successful, the memory map will always reside at the same virtual address
	and pointers used to reference data items in the database will be constant
	across multiple invocations. This option may not always work, depending on
	how the operating system has allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses.
	The feature is highly experimental.
<li>#MDB_NOSUBDIR
	By default, LMDB creates its environment in a directory whose
	pathname is given in \b path, and creates its data and lock files
	under that directory. With this option, \b path is used as-is for
	the database main data file. The database lock file is the \b path
	with "-lock" appended.
<li>#MDB_RDONLY
	Open the environment in read-only mode. No write operations will be
	allowed. LMDB will still modify the lock file - except on read-only
	filesystems, where LMDB does not use locks.
<li>#MDB_WRITEMAP
	Use a writeable memory map unless MDB_RDONLY is set. This uses
	fewer mallocs but loses protection from application bugs
	like wild pointer writes and other bad updates into the database.
	This may be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM, but
	is slower for DBs larger than RAM.
	Incompatible with nested transactions.
	Do not mix processes with and without MDB_WRITEMAP on the same
	environment.  This can defeat durability (#mdb_env_sync etc).
<li>#MDB_NOMETASYNC
	Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the
	metadata flush. Defer that until the system flushes files to disk,
	or next non-MDB_RDONLY commit or #mdb_env_sync(). This optimization
	maintains database integrity, but a system crash may undo the last
	committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity,
	consistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database property.
	This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
<li>#MDB_NOSYNC
	Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
	This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or
	lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk.
	The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers
	to disk and how often #mdb_env_sync() is called.  However, if the
	filesystem preserves write order and the #MDB_WRITEMAP flag is not
	used, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation)
	properties and only lose D (durability).  I.e. database integrity
	is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
	Note that (#MDB_NOSYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no
	hint for when to write transactions to disk, unless #mdb_env_sync()
	is called. (#MDB_MAPASYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) may be preferable.
	This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
<li>#MDB_MAPASYNC
	When using #MDB_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk.
	As with #MDB_NOSYNC, a system crash can then corrupt the
	database or lose the last transactions. Calling #mdb_env_sync()
	ensures on-disk database integrity until next commit.
	This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
<li>#MDB_NOTLS
	Don't use Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to
	#MDB_txn objects instead of to threads. I.e. #mdb_txn_reset() keeps
	the slot reseved for the #MDB_txn object. A thread may use parallel
	read-only transactions. A read-only transaction may span threads if
	the user synchronizes its use. Applications that multiplex many
	user threads over individual OS threads need this option. Such an
	application must also serialize the write transactions in an OS
	thread, since LMDB's write locking is unaware of the user threads.
<li>#MDB_NOLOCK
	Don't do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the
	caller must manage all concurrency itself. For proper operation
	the caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure
	that no readers are using old transactions while a writer is
	active. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that
	no readers may be active at all when a writer begins.
<li>#MDB_NORDAHEAD
	Turn off readahead. Most operating systems perform readahead on
	read requests by default. This option turns it off if the OS
	supports it. Turning it off may help random read performance
	when the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.
	The option is not implemented on Windows.
<li>#MDB_NOMEMINIT
	Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces
	in the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data
	file is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in
	subsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized
	to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other
	code (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the
	data file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate
	and free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may
	use the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a
	modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable
	it using this flag. This option can be a problem for applications
	which handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory
	checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with #MDB_WRITEMAP,
	which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The
	initialization is also skipped if #MDB_RESERVE is used; the
	caller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was
	reserved in that case.
	This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
</ul>
@param[in] mode The UNIX permissions to set on created files and semaphores.
This parameter is ignored on Windows.
@return A non-zero error value on failure and 0 on success. Some possible
errors are:
<ul>
<li>#MDB_VERSION_MISMATCH - the version of the LMDB library doesn't match the
version that created the database environment.
<li>#MDB_INVALID - the environment file headers are corrupted.
<li>ENOENT - the directory specified by the path parameter doesn't exist.
<li>EACCES - the user didn't have permission to access the environment files.
<li>EAGAIN - the environment was locked by another process.
</ul></div></details></section></div></main></body></html>
